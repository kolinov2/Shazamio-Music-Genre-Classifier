# Shazamio-Music-Genre-Classifier
This project is a simple GUI application that utilizes the Shazam API to classify music files into different genres. Users can select a music genre from a dropdown list, and the application will analyze the music files in a specified folder to determine their genre. Files matching the selected genre will be moved to a separate folder.
